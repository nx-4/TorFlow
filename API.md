# Streamix_Hub API

Streamix_Hub is a live WebTorrent-to-HTTP engine. It joins a WebTorrent swarm, resolves metadata, ranks healthy indexer results, prioritizes playback pieces, and streams physical file bytes through HTTP Range.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The resolver is autonomous by default: it queries built-in public adapters without an API key or Jackett deployment. `INDEXER_URL` and `INDEXER_API_KEY` are optional; when both are present, Torznab results are added to the public results. `RESOLVER_TIMEOUT_MS` is capped at 45000 milliseconds; each individual public provider remains capped at 3 seconds. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated CORS allowlist.

## Automated resolver

`POST /v1/resolver/find-stream`

```json
{ "title": "Dune", "year": 2021, "tmdb_id": "438631" }
```

TV example:

```json
{ "title": "The Last of Us", "season": 1, "episode": 3, "imdb_id": "tt3581920" }
```

Music example:

```json
{ "type": "music", "query": "Daft Punk Discovery", "artist": "Daft Punk", "album": "Discovery" }
```

For music, the built-in audio adapter searches public torrent JSON results, filters out candidates below 2 seeders, retries with a broader artist/album/track query when the detailed search has no healthy result, and prefers FLAC, ALAC, WAV, 320kbps MP3, AAC, and Opus in that order. The resolver inspects the returned torrent manifest and selects the individual `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.opus`, or `.alac` file rather than a cover image or unrelated file.

The service queries the built-in public adapters first, optionally queries Torznab, rejects candidates with fewer than 5 seeders, parses resolution/video/audio codec, and scores candidates using seed health plus player compatibility. It tries candidates in score order; if a public source times out or metadata/peers are unavailable, it falls back automatically.

Successful response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sourceType": "torrent",
    "streamId": "stream_abc",
    "infoHash": "...",
    "streamUrl": "/v1/torrents/.../files/0/stream",
    "fileIndex": 0,
    "quality": { "resolution": "1080p", "videoCodec": "h264", "audioCodec": "aac", "score": 74.2 },
    "audioTracks": ["movie.aac"],
    "subtitleTracks": ["movie.en.srt"],
    "candidate": { "title": "Dune.2021.1080p.x264.AAC", "seeders": 42, "score": 91.2 },
    "attempted": 1
  }
}
```

The client prefixes `streamUrl` with the API origin and passes it directly to Video.js, ExoPlayer, AVPlayer, Flutter, or React Native. The stream route supports `Range: bytes=start-end` and returns `206 Partial Content`. If a public swarm cannot return metadata or peers within the timeout, the API returns structured `504` JSON with `code: "SWARM_TIMEOUT"` instead of terminating the process.

### Subtitles

Resolver responses include a prioritized `subtitles` array. Arabic (`ara`) is selected as the default when present, followed by English, French, Spanish, and German. Torrent subtitle files with `.srt`, `.vtt`, or `.ass` extensions are served as WebVTT through `/v1/subtitles/:infoHash/:fileIndex` with `Content-Type: text/vtt; charset=utf-8` and permissive CORS.

```json
"subtitles": [
  { "lang": "ara", "label": "العربية", "isDefault": true, "url": "/v1/subtitles/<infoHash>/2", "source": "torrent", "fileIndex": 2 },
  { "lang": "eng", "label": "English", "isDefault": false, "url": "/v1/subtitles/<infoHash>/3", "source": "torrent", "fileIndex": 3 }
]
```

When `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY` is configured, missing Arabic or major-language tracks are queried from the OpenSubtitles REST API using IMDb/TMDB and season/episode identifiers. The server then requests a VTT download link and appends it to the response. Arabic is forced to `isDefault: true` whenever available. Without the key, the engine still serves all subtitles found inside the torrent, but cannot provide external fallback tracks.

Public providers are queried in parallel with a maximum 3-second timeout per provider. Video candidates with at least 1 seeder are eligible; music candidates require at least 2. Streamix_Hub is strictly torrent-only: every successful response has `sourceType: "torrent"`; if no healthy torrent remains or all candidates fail, the API returns `404` with `code: "NO_HEALTHY_TORRENT"`. No third-party ad-supported embed URL is returned.

## Metadata and streaming

- `POST /v1/metadata/inspect` accepts `{ "magnet": "magnet:?..." }` and joins the swarm directly.
- `GET /v1/torrents/:infoHash` returns a registered manifest.
- `GET /v1/torrents/:infoHash/files/:fileIndex/stream` returns the media stream.
- `GET /v1/streams/:streamId/status` returns progress.
- `GET /v1/streams/:streamId/events` opens an SSE status channel.

## Deployment

- Docker: `docker build -t streamix-hub . && docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env streamix-hub`
- Render: connect the repository and use `render.yaml`.
- Railway/VPS: `npm ci --omit=dev && npm run build && npm start`.
